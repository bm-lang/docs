= Constructors

Constructors are the only way to create an instance of a class, every class must have at least one constructor in order to be instantiable.
Constructors can only be invoked through the class name, they don't need an instance to be invoked.

When a class is inheriting from another class with already defined constructors, the constructor must be chained.

A class can be designed to be only extended and prevent it to have direct instances, this can be only reached through protected constructors.
Protected constructors can only be invoked in subclasses.

Constructors are not inherited so a constructor in a subclass can have the same name of a superclass constructor.

class Entity {
  export let id String;

  protect constructor new(@id String) {
    id = @id;
  }
}

class User inherits Entity {
  export let name;

  // `new` constructor can be declared since they are not inherited
  export constructor new(@id String, @name String)
    : Entity.new(@id) { // super-constructor can be accessed only here
    name = @name;
  }
}

function test() {
  let entity = Entity.new("0001");         // constructor is not accessible here
  let user = User.new("0001", "Mathison"); // accessible constructor
}
