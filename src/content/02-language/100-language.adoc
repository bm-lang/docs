= Language

Bm can be considered as a part of the C-family languages and influenced indeed by many other languages.
Driven by the <<Readability>> principle, the syntax of Bm is aims to be free of ambiguities for the parser
as well for the human who reads it.

The code written in Bm is free-form, there is no pattern to follow regarding the source files,
even so, the resulting code organization keeps being relatively simple
since the language doesn't allow to create intricated designs:

* <<Modules>> are the only members which can be recursively nested.
* <<Implicit Modules>> make explicit the module structure.
* There is no concept of _Inner Classes_ or _Static Members_.
